"""
Methods to rank/order data by cleanlab's `label quality score`.
Except for :py:func:`order_label_issues <cleanlab.rank.order_label_issues>`, which operates only on the subset of the data identified
as potential label issues/errors, the methods in this module can be used on whichever subset
of the dataset you choose (including the entire dataset) and provide a `label quality score` for
every example. You can then do something like: ``np.argsort(label_quality_score)`` to obtain ranked
indices of individual datapoints based on their quality.

Note: multi-label classification is not supported by most methods in this module,
each example must belong to a single class, e.g. format: ``labels = np.ndarray([1,0,2,1,1,0...])``.

CAUTION: These label quality scores are computed based on `pred_probs` from your model that must be out-of-sample!
You should never provide predictions on the same examples used to train the model,
as these will be overfit and unsuitable for finding label-errors.
To obtain out-of-sample predicted probabilities for every datapoint in your dataset, you can use :ref:`cross-validation <pred_probs_cross_val>`.
Alternatively it is ok if your model was trained on a separate dataset and you are only evaluating
labels in data that was previously held-out.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : np.ndarray
      A discrete vector of noisy labels, i.e. some labels may be erroneous.
      *Format requirements*: for dataset with K classes, labels must be in 0, 1, ..., K-1.
      All the classes (0, 1, ..., and K-1) MUST be present in ``labels``, such that: ``len(set(labels)) == pred_probs.shape[1]``
      Note: multi-label classification is not supported by this method, each example must belong to a single class, e.g. format: ``labels = np.ndarray([1,0,2,1,1,0...])``.

    pred_probs : np.ndarray, optional
      An array of shape ``(N, K)`` of model-predicted probabilities,
      ``P(label=k|x)``. Each row of this matrix corresponds
      to an example `x` and contains the model-predicted probabilities that
      `x` belongs to each possible class, for each of the K classes. The
      columns must be ordered such that these probabilities correspond to
      class 0, 1, ..., K-1.

      **Caution**: `pred_probs` from your model must be out-of-sample!
      You should never provide predictions on the same examples used to train the model,
      as these will be overfit and unsuitable for finding label-errors.
      To obtain out-of-sample predicted probabilities for every datapoint in your dataset, you can use :ref:`cross-validation <pred_probs_cross_val>`.
      Alternatively it is ok if your model was trained on a separate dataset and you are only evaluating
      data that was previously held-out.

    method : {"self_confidence", "normalized_margin", "confidence_weighted_entropy"}, default="self_confidence"
      Label quality scoring method.

      Letting ``k = labels[i]`` and ``P = pred_probs[i]`` denote the given label and predicted class-probabilities
      for datapoint *i*, its score can either be:

      - ``'normalized_margin'``: ``P[k] - max_{k' != k}[ P[k'] ]``
      - ``'self_confidence'``: ``P[k]``
      - ``'confidence_weighted_entropy'``: ``entropy(P) / self_confidence``

      Let ``C = {0, 1, ..., K-1}`` denote the specified set of classes for our classification task.

      The normalized_margin score works better for identifying class conditional label errors,
      i.e. examples for which another label in C is appropriate but the given label is not.

      The self_confidence score works better for identifying alternative label issues corresponding
      to bad examples that are: not from any of the classes in C, well-described by 2 or more labels in C,
      or generally just out-of-distribution (ie. anomalous outliers).

    adjust_pred_probs : bool, optional
      Account for class imbalance in the label-quality scoring by adjusting predicted probabilities
      via subtraction of class confident thresholds and renormalization.
      Set this to ``True`` if you prefer to account for class-imbalance.

def find_top_issues(quality_scores: np.ndarray, *, top: int = 10) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Returns the sorted indices of the `top` issues in `quality_scores`, ordered from smallest to largest quality score
    (i.e., from most to least likely to be an issue). For example, the first value returned is the index corresponding
    to the smallest value in `quality_scores` (most likely to be an issue). The second value in the returned array is
    the index corresponding to the second smallest value in `quality-scores` (second-most likely to be an issue), and so forth.

    This method assumes that `quality_scores` shares an index with some dataset such that the indices returned by this method
    map to the examples in that dataset. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    quality_scores :
      Array of shape ``(N,)``, where N is the number of examples, containing one quality score for each example in the dataset.

    top :
      The number of indices to return.

    Returns

    top_issue_indices :
      Indices of top examples most likely to suffer from an issue (ranked by issue severity)."""
